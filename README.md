# tidalBack

a server side random music generator.

I like when games have dynamic music. Like in the legend of zelda, when you approach an enemy and the chill walking around music melds into the scary fighty music. I figure that the same could be possible of a webpage or a roguelike game. The solution I decided on was using TidalCycles and dynamically generating different functions to produce music on the fly to fit a given situation. neat!

the system generates scales automatically via given or generated critera. these different scales and parameters have different qualities. something locrian in  7/8 is more unsettling than a major scale in 3/4.
this is by no means intended to create deeply complex music. most creations will be based on arpeggios and ambient samples.

a server side random music generator.

I like when games have dynamic music. Like in the legend of zelda, when you approach an enemy and the chill walking around music melds into the scary fighty music. I figure that the same could be possible of a webpage or a roguelike game. The solution I decided on was using TidalCycles and dynamically generating different functions to produce music on the fly to fit a given situation. neat!
